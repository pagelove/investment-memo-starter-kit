            <h1>Pagelove - what it's all about</h1>
            <p>
                Pagelove is a new way to think about building web applications, that's more like the old way.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because we have come to think of the web as an application delivery mechanism, the amount of
                tooling, frameworks, and libraries that are needed to just get started with anything is truly
                staggering. With the rise of node.js APIs and single page applications, we have moved away
                from the foundational ideas of the web, to a world where the web is just a big dumb pipe.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pagelove enables surgical DOM manipulations using standard HTTP and HTML. This makes for
                much simpler applications, that don't require complex state management in the client.
            </p>
            <p>
                But radically simpler applications aren't a business. The business of pagelove comes
                when you realize that because pagelove is just HTML and HTTP, it lives at the edge.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pagelove is the perfect platform for edge computing, because the only state is the document state.

                After you've made some changes, you'll see the network inspector update
                with the request that goes to the server, and makes the changes persistent.            
            </p>
            <p>
                Your request looked like this:
                <network-last-request></network-last-request>
            </p>
            <p>
                No complex API call, no scaffolding needed. Just HTTP. Just HTML.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just the Web.
